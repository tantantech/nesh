# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03)

**Core value:** Running AI-assisted commands feels as natural and fast as running normal shell commands
**Current focus:** Phase 09 — completion-engine-utility-plugins

## Current Position

Phase: 09 (completion-engine-utility-plugins) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-05

Progress: [██████████████░░░░░░] 70% (v1.0 + v2.0 complete, v3.0 0/5 phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 20 (v1.0: 9, v2.0: 11)
- Average duration: ~3 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~55 min

**By Phase (recent):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 04 P01-P03 | 3 | 8min | 3min |
| Phase 05 P01-P03 | 3 | 9min | 3min |
| Phase 06 P01-P03 | 3 | 12min | 4min |
| Phase 07 P01-P02 | 2 | 4min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 3min, 6min, 3min, 2min, 2min
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 08 P01 | 2min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 08 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 8 files |
| Phase 08 P03 | 4min | 3 tasks | 8 files |
| Phase 09 P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 8 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v3.0]: OMZ plugins in TypeScript (not zsh subprocess) for cross-platform support
- [v3.0]: Bundled + git installable plugins (core built-in, long tail from git repos)
- [v3.0]: Profile-based defaults instead of configuring 300 plugins individually
- [v3.0]: Two-phase startup mandatory (sync alias <50ms, async init deferred)
- [v3.0]: rl.line must ALWAYS remain plain text (output-only rendering for highlighting/suggestions)
- [v3.0]: All plugin config uses interactive selection menus (like theme/model builtins)
- [v3.0]: Error boundaries on ALL plugin lifecycle calls from Phase 8
- [Phase 08]: User aliases silently override plugin aliases; plugin collisions warn and last-loaded wins
- [Phase 08]: Kahn's algorithm for topological sort -- O(V+E), naturally detects cycles
- [Phase 08]: prePrompt hook fire-and-forget (no await) per D-26 to avoid blocking prompt
- [Phase 09]: Fig-style spec types are standalone (no dependency on fig package)
- [Phase 09]: Generator timeout 1s via Promise.race; compgen subprocess timeout 500ms

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: readline keypress timing (rl.line/rl.cursor update order) needs empirical testing on Node 22+
- [Research]: emphasize bundle size impact on tsdown bundle -- lazy-load if >500KB
- [Research]: Fig completion spec format -- define own TS types, don't depend on their package
