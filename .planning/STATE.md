# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** Running AI-assisted commands feels as natural and fast as running normal shell commands
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — ai-integration

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (ai-integration) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Coarse granularity -- 3 phases derived from requirement clusters
- [Roadmap]: PLAT-01 (macOS) in Phase 1 as primary dev platform; PLAT-02 (Linux) deferred to Phase 3 for cross-platform validation
- [Phase 01]: Node16 module resolution for ESM compatibility
- [Phase 01]: ReadonlySet and readonly properties for immutability
- [Phase 01]: Pure function modules for prompt and classifier (no side effects)
- [Phase 01]: cd returns immutable CdState with previousDir tracking
- [Phase 01]: History uses synchronous fs for shell startup/shutdown simplicity
- [Phase 01]: spawn bash with inherited stdio for transparent terminal I/O
- [Phase 01]: Catch ERR_USE_AFTER_CLOSE for Ctrl+D readline edge case
- [Phase 01]: Spawn-based integration testing pattern for CLI verification
- [Phase 02-ai-integration]: Replace ai_placeholder with ai in InputAction union for cleaner naming
- [Phase 02-ai-integration]: Stderr tee pattern: pipe to buffer AND process.stderr for real-time display plus capture
- [Phase 02-ai-integration]: Config resolution: env var ANTHROPIC_API_KEY first, then ~/.claudeshell/config JSON
- [Phase 02-ai-integration]: Stream raw text for v1; markdown rendering deferred to v2
- [Phase 02-ai-integration]: Simple dim Thinking... on stderr instead of ora spinner
- [Phase 02-ai-integration]: Updated integration test to verify API key error instead of removed placeholder message

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Claude Agent SDK is at v0.2.x -- API surface may shift. Pin exact versions during Phase 2.
- `a` prefix may collide with user aliases -- consider detection or configurability.
