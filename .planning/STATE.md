## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Coarse granularity -- 3 phases derived from requirement clusters
- [Roadmap]: PLAT-01 (macOS) in Phase 1 as primary dev platform; PLAT-02 (Linux) deferred to Phase 3 for cross-platform validation
- [Phase 01]: Node16 module resolution for ESM compatibility
- [Phase 01]: ReadonlySet and readonly properties for immutability
- [Phase 01]: Pure function modules for prompt and classifier (no side effects)
- [Phase 01]: cd returns immutable CdState with previousDir tracking
- [Phase 01]: History uses synchronous fs for shell startup/shutdown simplicity
- [Phase 01]: spawn bash with inherited stdio for transparent terminal I/O
- [Phase 01]: Catch ERR_USE_AFTER_CLOSE for Ctrl+D readline edge case
- [Phase 01]: Spawn-based integration testing pattern for CLI verification

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Claude Agent SDK is at v0.2.x -- API surface may shift. Pin exact versions during Phase 2.
- `a` prefix may collide with user aliases -- consider detection or configurability.
