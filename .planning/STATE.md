# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-02)

**Core value:** Running AI-assisted commands feels as natural and fast as running normal shell commands
**Current focus:** Phase 07 — pty-polish

## Current Position

Phase: 07 (pty-polish) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2
Status: Executing Phase 07
Last activity: 2026-04-02 - Completed quick task 260402-vmf: Rebrand claudeshell to nesh -- Phase 07 execution started

Progress: [██████░░░░] 67% (4/6 v2.0 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 9 (from v1.0)
- Average duration: ~3 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~25 min

**By Phase (v1.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Shell Foundation | 4 | 12min | 3min |
| 2. AI Integration | 3 | 8min | 3min |
| 3. Distribution & Platform | 2 | 5min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 3min, 2min, 3min, 3min, 2min
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 04 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 04 P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 04 P03 | 2min | 3 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 05 P01 | 2min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 05 P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 05 P03 | 4min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 06-context-permissions P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 06-context-permissions P03 | 3min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 06 P02 | 6min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0 Roadmap]: Sessions first (Phase 4) -- session ID is the shared state primitive that permissions, context, and cost attach to
- [v2.0 Roadmap]: PTY deferred to last (Phase 7) -- highest risk (node-pty native build), lowest user coverage
- [v2.0 Research]: 9 of 10 v2 features need zero new dependencies; primarily integration/wiring work
- [v1.0]: `a` prefix collision risk -- configurable prefix addressed in Phase 5 (CFG-01)
- [Phase 04]: Session cost uses 4dp precision for sub-dollar amounts; per-message uses 2dp threshold at $0.01
- [Phase 04]: extractUsage takes plain object shape (not SDK type) for testability and decoupling
- [Phase 04]: Model flags parsed as first token after 'a ' prefix for simplicity
- [Phase 04]: renderCostFooter is standalone export, not part of Renderer interface -- shell.ts controls display
- [Phase 04]: MODEL_SHORTHANDS in chat.ts; chat history swapped via rl.history; single-shot shows per-msg cost only
- [Phase 05]: Skip auto-fix AI call when no API key configured to avoid blocking in CI/test
- [Phase 05]: Prefix defaults to 'a' via nullish coalescing; validation rejects whitespace to prevent ambiguous parsing
- [Phase 06]: ProjectContext uses first-match primary type from ordered marker list; only package.json parsed for metadata
- [Phase 06-context-permissions]: refreshProjectState is module-private helper; auto-fix uses permissionMode auto; cd preserves permissionMode if no project override
- [Phase 06]: Non-TTY stdin forces ask mode to auto to prevent hanging in piped mode

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Verify exact SDK field names for `SDKResultMessage` cost/token fields before implementing cost.ts (MEDIUM confidence)
- [Research]: Verify `session_id` field and `resume` option behavior against installed SDK v0.2.88
